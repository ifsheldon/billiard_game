# Billiard Game

Non-rotational billiard game with a soft implementation (in Python) and a hard implementation (in Verilog).

For the soft implementation, see [code](code). 

For the hard implementations of individual components, see [pyverilog](pyverilog).

For the integrated implementation in Verilog, see [vivado](vivado).

For physics in the non-rotational billiard game, see [Physics of Billiard Game](Physics%20of%20Billiard%20Game.md).
